# 映画館 eigakan

A web server to upload and stream videos files in a home server.

The main idea is to create a youtube like system but at small scale, just for a home network.

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
